            <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Here's the scoop from Doughp's founder on how this flavor came to be: "I first made Red Velvet on a total whim,
              just a few months into business in 2017. One day, while mixing up Doughp at our original commercial kitchen in
              Oakland, I left to grab some lunch at a nearby bakery.</p>
            <p>I saw an absolutely delicious-looking red velvet cake in their dessert case and immediately thought: I NEED to
              know what this tastes like in cookie dough! I bought the cake and mixed it right into a small 5lb batch of
              Doughp; cream cheese frosting, cake and all! HEAVEN by the spoonful!"</p>
